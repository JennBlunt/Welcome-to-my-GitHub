Hi! I'm Jenn. 

I'm a Full Stack Web Dev, I graduated from BrainStation's full time program in Dec 2018.

I will be adding course projects shortly, as well as new indipendent projects. I'll be sure to include notes on the BrainStation projects as context, so please be sure to check out their READMEs

In the meantime, you can get in touch with me at jennbluntcodes@gmail.com or find my LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-blunt/

See you soon!

Jenn
